 My name is José María Sallán Leyes (NBU: Jose M Sallan), and I work as Associate Professor at at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC). I am attached to the Department of Management, and I am currently teaching at the School of Industrial, Aerospace and Audiovisual Engineering (ESEIAAT) and the Barcelona School of Building Construction (EPSEB).
 
My research interests cover a broad range of facets of industrial organization: organizational and consumer behavior, air transport management and analysis of transportation networks. I am member of the Advisory Board of Management Decision, and editor of the Journal of Airline and Airport Management.

My teaching covers three broad topics: air transport and airport operations, optimization problems and business analytics. R and RStudio pervades all my teaching, and my colleagues and I advocate a hands-on, practical approach to learning industrial engineering.
