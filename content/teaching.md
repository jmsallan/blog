## Materials

### R packages

*I am maintaining the following R packages for teaching (available at GitHub):*

* [BAdatasets](https://github.com/jmsallan/BAdatasets): datasets to illustrate machine learning algorithms in a Business Analytics course.
* [BAdatasetsSpatial](https://github.com/jmsallan/BAdatasetsSpatial): datasets to illustrate visualisation with maps.
* [combheuristics](https://github.com/jmsallan/combheuristics): a package including some functions implementing heuristics for combinatorial problems, and some datasets for testing.

### Course materials

*I am maintaining the following GitHub repositories with course materials (slides, R code and Rmarkdown reports):*

* [linearprogramming](https://github.com/jmsallan/linearprogramming): the companion for the Modeling and Solving Linear Programming with R book.
* [analytics](https://github.com/jmsallan/analytics): contents for a course on business analytics.
* [optimization](https://github.com/jmsallan/optimization): introduction to optimization algorithms and applications, using functions from combheuristics.
