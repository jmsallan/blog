<p>In the moment of the COVID-19 pandemic we are living, we sometimes hear concerns about the efficacy of vaccines. One of the reasons argued against vaccination is that among infected with COVID-19 there is more vaccinated than unvaccinated people. The aim of this post is to show that <strong>as more people receive effective vaccines, the proportion of vaccinated among infected people will also increase.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s suppose that we have a population <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of one million in a region where a fraction <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of 10% is infected with COVID-19 when not vaccinated. This means that with <strong>no vaccination</strong> we have <strong>100,000</strong> people infected.</p>
<p>Let’s introduce a vaccine with an <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection">efficacy</a> <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> of 80%. This means that 80% of the people that would be infected without the vaccine will get rid of the disease if vaccinated. So, if only 20% out of 10% will be infected, the vaccine reduces the infection rate from 10% to 2% for the vaccinated.</p>
<p>When we have the <strong>30%</strong> of the population vaccinated, we can expect 70,000 (10% out of 700,000) of infected among the unvaccinated. Among the 300,000 vaccinated, we will have only 6,000 people infected (the 2% of 300,000). So we have <strong>70,000 + 6,000 = 76,000</strong> people infected.</p>
<p>What happens when the vaccination rate raises to <strong>70%</strong>? We can expect 30,000 infected among the 300,000 unvaccinated, but only 14,000 out of the 700,000 vaccinated. So we have now <strong>30,000 + 14,000 = 44,000</strong> people infected. There are less people infected now, but the proportion of vaccinated among infected raises to 31.8%.</p>
<p>With a vaccination rate of <strong>90%</strong>, we have only 10,000 infected among a population of 100,000 still unvaccinated, and 18,000 infected among the 900,000 vaccinated. We have now <strong>10,000 + 18,000 = 28,000</strong> infected. Now the 64% of infected are vaccinated people.</p>
<p>In the chart below I am presenting how is evolving the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated infected as the coverage of the vaccine increases.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We observe that <strong>as the fraction of vaccinated people increases, the total number of infected decreases, and the proportion of vaccinated among the infected also increases.</strong> As we want less people infected, media should pay more attention to the evolution of the total of infected people, rather than to the proportion of vaccinated among infected.</p>
<p>Let’s examine more formally the evolution of the fraction of vaccinated among infected <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> as a function of the fraction of vaccinated <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. The parameters to consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The population <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</li>
<li>The proportion of infected people <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> when there are no vaccines available. Its value depends on the measures taken to control the spread of the infection, so it can be different for each population.</li>
<li>The efficacy of the vaccine <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of <strong>infected, unvaccinated</strong> people is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P\left(1-v\right)i\]</span></p>
<p>While an unvaccinated individual has a probability of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of being infected, a vaccinated individual will have a probability of infection <span class="math inline">\(\left(1-e\right)i\)</span>. So, the number of <strong>infected, vaccinated</strong> people is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Pv\left(1-e\right)i\]</span></p>
<p>The <strong>total number of infected people</strong> will be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I = P\left(1-v\right)i + Pv\left(1-e\right)i = P\left(1-ve\right)i \]</span></p>
<p>If we normalize this value with the number of infected people with no vaccines <span class="math inline">\(Pi\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ I_n = \frac{I}{Pi}  = 1-ve \]</span></p>
<p>And the ratio of <strong>vaccinated and infected respect to total infected</strong> will be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r = \frac{Pv\left(1-e\right)i}{P\left(1-ve\right)i} = \frac{v-ve}{1-ve}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that if <span class="math inline">\(v=0\)</span> the ratio is equal to zero, and if <span class="math inline">\(v=1\)</span> is equal to one. This makes sense, as in the later case there are no unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>Let’s examine the ratio of vaccinated, infected people for the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa210889">Pfizer and AZ vaccines with the delta variant</a> (<span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> equal to 88% and 67% respectively), together with an hypothetical vaccine of efficacy of 30% as vaccination rate grows.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>IF we examine the total number of infected, we observe that the value of <span class="math inline">\(I_n\)</span> will decrease linearly:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Increasing the number of vaccinated people has two effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing the number of infected people</li>
<li>reducing the number of unvaccinated people.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two effects combined make that, for <strong>high rates of vaccination, there are more vaccinated than unvaccinated people among the infected</strong>. <a href="https://www.abc.es/sociedad/abci-vacunacion-espana-datos-porcentajes-poblacion-vacunada-coronavirus-comunidades-nsv-202107201018_noticia.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fkeep.google.com%2F">In Spain</a>, the 100% of individuals of 80 years or more are vaccinated. The 98.4% of 70-79 years old and 95.2% of 60-69 years old are vaccinated. These values of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> are high enough to observe values of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> larger than 0.5.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, we must pay attention to the evolution of total number of infected people to track the evolution of COVID-19, rather than the proportion of vaccinated people among infected.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 and the delta variant</h2>
<p>In this post, I have been using efficacy values for the delta variant of COVID-19. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html">According to the CDC</a>, the delta variant of COVID-19 is more contagious, and might cause more severe illness than previous variants in unvaccinated people. A recent study from <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891">Lopez Bernal et al.</a> has shown that the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines have lower efficacy for the delta variant than for the alpha variant.</p>

<p>Although the efficacy of vaccines might have been reduced because of this delta variant, the dire consequences of this variant of COVID-19 for the unvaccinated make getting your vaccine the wisest choice.</p>
