This post is motivated by the reading of cole nussbaumer knaflic's *Storytelling with data*. Her book is aimed to visualization and presentation of quantitative data in the business context.

Here is a list of online resources about data visualization, infographics and how to present data-driven content. They are about how to present visual data in an appealing and informative way, in the context of business and media.

I expect to update this post from time to time. Last update was on **1 December 2022**.

* **HelpMeViz** (Jonathan Schwabish) <https://policyviz.com/helpmeviz/>. *HelpMeViz* is open to anyone who is searching for feedback on their visualization designs. Useful to learn about how to improve your visualizations with all kinds of examples.
