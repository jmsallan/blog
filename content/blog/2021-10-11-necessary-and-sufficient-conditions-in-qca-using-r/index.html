<p><strong>Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)</strong> is a data analysis technique that examines the relationships between an outcome and a set of explanatory variables using Boolean algebra, rather than analysis of correlation or covariance structures. Unlike other techniques like linear regression, QCA is focused mainly on examining complex combinations of explanatory variables as antecedents of the outcome.</p>
<p>Relationships between conditions and outcomes in QCA are established as necessary and sufficient conditions. In this post, I will introduce these two types of conditions, and how can they be assessed in fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA) using the <code>QCA</code> package in R. I will also use the <code>tidyverse</code> and <code>patchwork</code> for data manipulation and plotting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(QCA)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)</code></pre>
<p>Along this post, I will be using the fuzzy-set version of Lipset’s (1959) indicators for the survival of democracy during the inter-war period, included in the <code>QCA</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(LF)</code></pre>

<p>I will also use the crisp-set version of the same dataset:</p>

<h2>Analysis of necessity</h2>
<p>Social phenomena may depend on many complex causal configurations, although some may be more important than others. <strong>Necessary conditions</strong> are those without which the outcome cannot occur. Baumoller and Goetz (2000) established that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a necessary condition of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> if:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is always present when <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> occurs,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> does not occur in the absence of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of set theory, set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a necessary condition of set <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>We represent the necessity relationship as <span class="math inline">\(X \Leftarrow Y\)</span></p>
<p>Let’s examine which variables are necessary conditions of the outcome <code>SURV</code> in the crisp version of the Lipset dataset <code>LC</code>. To do so, we examine the cases included in set <code>SURV</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>LC %&gt;% filter(SURV == 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    DEV URB LIT IND STB SURV
## BE   1   1   1   1   1    1
## CZ   1   1   1   1   1    1
## FI   1   0   1   0   1    1
## FR   1   0   1   1   1    1
## IE   1   0   1   0   1    1
## NL   1   1   1   1   1    1
## SE   1   0   1   1   1    1
## UK   1   1   1   1   1    1</code></pre>
<p>We observe that all elements of set <code>SURV</code> are also included in sets <code>DEV</code>, <code>LIT</code> and <code>STB</code>. So, these are necessary conditions for <code>SURV</code> to happen. The reverse implication does not hold: for instance, if we pick all cases where <code>DEV</code> occurs we observe that two of them to <code>SURV</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>LC %&gt;% select(DEV, SURV) %&gt;% filter(DEV == 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    DEV SURV
## AU   1    0
## BE   1    1
## CZ   1    1
## FI   1    1

<p>With fuzzy sets, the condition of necessity that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> means that <strong>if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a necessary condition of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, fuzzy scores of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are higher than fuzzy scores of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</strong> If we plot fuzzy memberships of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> versus fuzzy memberships of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, cases of necessary conditions will appear in the lower area of the plot:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In real datasets, a condition is rarely a perfect necessary condition. We examine the extent to which a condition is necessary with consistency and coverage.</p>
<p>The <strong>consistency</strong> or <strong>inclusion</strong> of a necessary condition is the extent to which <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a necessary condition of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In fuzzy sets it is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[inc\left(X \Leftarrow Y \right) = \frac{ \sum min\left(X,Y\right)}{\sum Y}\]</span></p>
<p>A value of consistency close to one means that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is close to be a necessary condition for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>: inclusion only is present when consistency is equal to one. In the <code>LC</code> dataset, <code>DEV</code>, <code>LIT</code> and <code>STB</code> have values of consistency equal to one.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> may be a necessary condition of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, but it can happen that many members of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> do not belong to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. To account for this, we define <strong>coverage</strong> for fuzzy sets as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[cov\left(X \Leftarrow Y \right) = \frac{ \sum min\left(X,Y\right)}{\sum X}\]</span></p>
<p>A coverage close to one means that most of the elements of set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are also included in set <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In the sample <code>LC</code> the set <code>DEV</code> has ten elements, of which eight belong to set <code>SURV</code>: the coverage for <code>DEV</code> is 0.8. A high coverage for a necessary condition shows that it is a relevant one to explain the outcome.</p>
<p>If all or most of all the elements of the sample belong to the set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, it is very likely that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a necessary condition of any outcome, but a trivial one. For instance, air is necessary for fire, but we always have air available so air can be considered a trivial condition for fire. To account for this, Schneider and Wagemann (2012) defined the <strong>relevance</strong> of a necessary condition as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[rel\left(X \Leftarrow Y \right) = \frac{ \sum \left(1-X\right)}{\sum \left( 1- min\left(X,Y\right)\right)}\]</span></p>
<p>An example of non-relevant condition for the <code>LC</code> crisp dataset is the <code>LIT</code> variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>LC %&gt;% select(LIT, SURV) %&gt;% filter(LIT == 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    LIT SURV
## AU   1    0
## BE   1    1
## CZ   1    1
## EE   1    0
## FI   1    1
## FR   1    1
## DE   1    0
## HU   1    0
## IE   1    1
## NL   1    1
## PL   1    0
## SE   1    1
## UK   1    1</code></pre>
<p>Thirteen out of eighteen cases of the dataset are included in <code>LIT</code>. As a consequence, its relevance is of 0.5 and it can be considered as a condition of low relevance. .</p>
<p>We can obtain consistency, coverage and relevance for specific conditions with the <code>pof</code> function. <code>setms</code> is a data frame with columns with the conditions or a sum of products expression, and <code>data</code> is the dataset with the scores. Here we are assessing the fuzzy-set dataset <code>LF</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pof(setms = LF %&gt;% select(-SURV),  outcome = &quot;SURV&quot;, data = LF, relation = &quot;necessity&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##         inclN   RoN   covN  
## --------------------------- 
## 1  DEV  0.831  0.811  0.775 
## 2  URB  0.539  0.899  0.771 
## 3  LIT  0.991  0.509  0.643 
## 4  IND  0.669  0.786  0.684 
## 5  STB  0.920  0.680  0.707 
## ---------------------------</code></pre>
<p>We can achieve the same using a sum of products expression:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pof(setms = &quot;DEV+URB+LIT+IND+STB&quot;, outcome = &quot;SURV&quot;, data = LF, relation = &quot;necessity&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##                inclN   RoN   covN  
## ---------------------------------- 
## 1         DEV  0.831  0.811  0.775 
## 2         URB  0.539  0.899  0.771 
## 3         LIT  0.991  0.509  0.643 
## 4         IND  0.669  0.786  0.684 
## 5         STB  0.920  0.680  0.707 
## 6  expression  1.000  0.357  0.583 
## ----------------------------------</code></pre>
<p>In the last row we obtain the parameters for the whole logical expression. Values of inclusion appear on the <code>inclN</code> column, relevance on <code>RoN</code> and coverage on <code>covN</code>.</p>
<p>In the following plots, I am comparing the fuzzy scores of <code>SURV</code> with three variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DEV</code>: a condition with high consistency, relevance and coverage.</li>
<li><code>LIT</code>: a condition with high consistency, but low relevance.</li>
<li><code>URB</code>: a condition with low consistency.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Note that as scores of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> should be higher than scores of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, most of the cases must be in the lower triangle for a necessary condition to be consistent. This is what is happening with <code>DEV</code> and <code>LIT</code>, but not with <code>URB</code>. In the <code>LIT</code> plot, we observe that many cases have an score near to one: that’s why <code>LIT</code> has less relevance than <code>DEV</code>.</p>
<p>We can do an analysis of necessity with logical expressions presented in a <strong>sum of products format</strong>, where the product <code>*</code> stands for the AND logical operator (set intersection) and the sum <code>+</code> for the OR operator (set union). We can negate variables using the <code>~</code> symbol.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pof(setms = &quot;DEV*~LIT+IND*STB&quot;, outcome = &quot;SURV&quot;, data = LF, relation = &quot;necessity&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##                inclN   RoN   covN  
## ---------------------------------- 
## 1    DEV*~LIT  0.045  0.984  0.567 
## 2     IND*STB  0.664  0.873  0.783 
## 3  expression  0.670  0.872  0.784 
## ----------------------------------</code></pre>
<p>Here we have examined necessity relations of original explanatory variables, but we might want to explore possible necessity relations of all possible sums of products. We can do that with the <code>superSubset</code> function. It explores all possible necessity relationships, and present those with minimum values of consistency, coverage or relevance. Here I have retained conditions with consistency higher than 0.8 and relevance higher than 0.7.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>superSubset(LF, &quot;SURV&quot;, incl.cut = 0.9, ron.cut = 0.7)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##                 inclN   RoN   covN  
## ----------------------------------- 
## 1  LIT*STB      0.915  0.800  0.793 
## 2  DEV+URB+IND  0.903  0.704  0.716

<div id="analysis-of-sufficiency" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis of sufficiency</h2>
<p>The aim of the analysis of sufficiency is to find the minimal configurations that are sufficient to obtain the outcome set. The formal definition of sufficiency is structurally similar to necessity. We say that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a <strong>sufficient</strong> condition for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when:</p>
<ul>
<li>every time <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is present, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is present.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> does not occur in the absence of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of set theory, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a sufficient condition for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. When applying fuzzy logic, <strong>the fuzzy scores of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> must be higher than the ones of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></strong>. For perfect sufficiency, all cases must be in the upper triangle of the <span class="math inline">\(\left(X,Y\righ)\)</span> plot.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can define the <strong>consistency</strong> or <strong>inclusion</strong> of a sufficient relationship as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[inc\left(X \Rightarrow Y \right) = \frac{ \sum min\left(X,Y\right)}{\sum X}\]</span></p>
<p>A perfect sufficient relationship will have a consistency score of one. The smaller the consistency, the further is the condition for being sufficient to obtain the outcome.</p>
<p>In some cases, we find that a condition can be sufficient to explain the outcome and the negated outcome, examining consistency and coverage alone. To illustrate this, we can use data from Dușa (2021):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pri_test &lt;- data.frame(X = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6),
Y = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.7))</code></pre>
<p>Let’s examine the sufficiency of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for $Y and for <span class="math inline">\(\sim Y\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pof(pri_test %&gt;% select(X), &quot;Y&quot;, pri_test, relation = &quot;sufficiency&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##        inclS   PRI   covS   covU  
## --------------------------------- 
## 1   X  1.000  1.000  0.811    -   
## ---------------------------------</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>pof(pri_test %&gt;% select(X), &quot;~Y&quot;, pri_test, relation = &quot;sufficiency&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##        inclS   PRI   covS   covU  
## --------------------------------- 
## 1   X  0.814  0.000  0.745    -   
## ---------------------------------</code></pre>
<p>For both outcomes we observe good values of consistence and coverage for sufficiency, but we cannot make a condition sufficient for the outcome and its negation. To help to choose between the two outcomes Ragin (2006) defines the <strong>proportional reduction of inconsistency (PRI)</strong> rate as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ PRI = \frac{ \sum min\left(X,Y\right) - \sum min\left( X, Y, \sim Y \right)}{\sum X - \sum min\left( X, Y, \sim Y \right)} \]</span></p>
<p>We assign the condition to the outcome with the largest PRI, in this case <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(\sim Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>The concept of sufficiency allows for more than one sufficient condition to explain the outcome. That’s why QCA is particularly suitable to analyze situations of <strong>equifinality</strong>, where an outcome can be obtained in different ways. In the context of sufficiency, <strong>raw coverage</strong> measures how much of the outcome Y is explained by a condition X:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[cov\left(X \Rightarrow Y \right) = \frac{ \sum min\left(X,Y\right)}{\sum Y}\]</span></p>
<p>If we have obtained more than one set of sufficient conditions <span class="math inline">\(A, B, C, \dots\)</span>, some cases might belong to more than one condition. We may be interested in finding how much a condition alone explains the outcome in this context. This is measured by the <strong>unique coverage</strong>, measured as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ covU\left(A \Rightarrow Y \right) = \frac{\sum min\left(A,Y\right) - \sum min\left(A,Y, max\left(B, C, \dots \right)\right)}{\sum Y}  \]</span></p>
<p>A typical task of a sufficient condition analysis is to find all the sufficient conditions. This task is carried out in two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a value of outcome to existing combinations of observable variables through a <strong>truth table</strong>.</li>
<li>Simplify the conditions where the outcome is observed with a minimization process using the <strong>Quine-McCluskey algorithm</strong>.</li>
</ul>
