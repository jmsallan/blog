Combinatorial optimization is about picking one element of a set of finite objects that optimizes an objective function. Put in this way, the solution may seem straightforward: just enumerate all elements of the set and assess the objective function for each object.

The problem with this na√Øve approach is that the number of elements of the set can be very large. Let's consider, for instance, the symmetric travelling salesperson problem. For an instance of $n$ nodes, the number of possible solutions is $\left(n-1\right)!/2$. This means that, for a problem of size $n=20$, and taking one millisecond to assess each solution, it takes around 1,108,606 years to assess all solutions. This effect is called **combinatorial explosion**.

This video shows an example of an even faster combinatorial explosion. Additionally, helps in learning how to count large numbers in Japanese...
